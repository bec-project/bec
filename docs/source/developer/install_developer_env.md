## Install developer / expert environment



If you want to install the BEC server for development purposes, make sure you have git and conda installed. Then, run


```bash
git clone https://gitlab.psi.ch/bec/ophyd_devices.git
git clone https://gitlab.psi.ch/bec/bec.git
cd bec
```

On PSI-maintained systems with pmodules, you can skip the installation of redis and tmux and instead use the existing pmodules for redis and tmux:

```bash
module add redis/7.0.12
module add tmux/3.2
source ./bin/install_bec_dev.sh -r -t
```
On all other systems, run

```bash
source ./bin/install_bec_dev.sh
```

```{tip}
If you need to connect to redis on a different port than the default (6379), you can create a service config file based on the template
in ``bec/bec_config_template.yaml`` and pass it to the bec-server using the ``--config`` flag.
```

Once everything is installed, run

```bash
bec-server start
```

```{note}
Strictly speaking, you do not need to install tmux. However, if you do not use tmux, you need to start each service manually in a separate terminal. Tmux simplifies this process by starting all services in a single terminal.
```

To start the client, run

```bash
bec
```
