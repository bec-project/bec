# Beamline Specific Integration 
Seamlessly integrating devices across beamlines while accommodating beamline-specific requirements is a critical aspect of reliable device management. Ideally, a device can be reused across multiple beamlines without compromising its core functionality. At the same time, beamline-specific requirements, such as customised behavior during scans, should be easily implemented. This section explains how to achieve this balance without rewriting the entire device class for each beamline.

## Example - Customise EpicsMotor 
```` {note}
If the beamline does not require any customisation of the device, the device can be used as an [EpicsMotor](https://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd/builtin-devices.html#epicsmotor). Please check the [device configuration section](#developer.ophyd_device_config) for more details on how to load and use the device. 
````
Letâ€™s consider a scenario where a motor must operate with a specific velocity during certain scans at a beamline. We can create a new class inheriting from `EpicsMotor` and extend its functionality to meet these requirements.

``` python
from ophyd import EpicsMotor

class MyBeamlineMotor(EpicsMotor):
    def stage(self):
        """Set velocity during staging."""
        self.velocity.set(2).wait()  # Set velocity to 2
        return super().stage()
```
This customisation modifies the *stage* method to adjust the velocity during the preparation phase for a scan. While this addresses basic requirements, it does not account for more complex scenarios, such as restoring the velocity after a scan or adjusting it only for specific scan types.

**Advanced Customisation**

To handle more advanced requirements, such as adapting behavior based on scan type and restoring the original velocity after a scan, we need to extend the logic further.

``` python
from bec_lib import messages
from bec_lib.endpoints import MessageEndpoints
from ophyd import EpicsMotor

class MyBeamlineMotor(EpicsMotor):

   def __init__(self, prefix="", *, name, kind=None, parent=None, device_manager=None, **kwargs):
      super().__init__(prefix, name=name, kind=kind, parent=parent, **kwargs)
      self.device_manager = device_manager
      self._stored_velocity = None

   def stage(self):
      """Stage the motor"""
      scan_msg = self.get_scaninfo()
      # No scan message available, proceed without any actions
      if scan_msg is None:
         return super().stage()
      # Get the scan type
      scan_type = scan_msg.content["info"].get("scan_type")
      if scan_type == "fly":
         # Store velocity
         self._stored_velocity = self.velocity.get()
         # Set velocity to 2 during staging
         self.user_velocity.set(2).wait()
      return super().stage()

   def get_scaninfo(self) -> messages.ScanStatusMessage:
      """Get current scan message"""
      msg = self.device_manager.connector.get(MessageEndpoints.scan_status())
      if not isinstance(msg, messages.ScanStatusMessage):
         return None
      return msg

   def unstage(self):
      """Unstage the motor"""
      # restore the old velocity if it was stored
      if self._stored_velocity is not None:
         self.user_velocity.set(self._stored_velocity).wait()
      return super().unstage()
```
In this enhanced version:
- *device_manager*: The *device_manager* is injected as a dependency during initialisation providing access to the connector class for retrieving scan-related information. This happens automatically on the device server if the device has *device_manager* in its signature.
- *dynamic behaviour*: The *stage* method retrieves the scan type from BEC and adjusts the motor's velocity for *fly* scans automatically.
- *state restoration*: The *unstage* method restores the original velocity if it was changed during staging.

**Why a Generic Approach Matters**

Customising devices is often necessary, but repeating similar logic across multiple beamlines can lead to code duplication and maintenance challenges. Instead, we recommend adopting a more generic approach to encapsulate beamline-specific logic in a single place. This approach separates the device communication logic from the beamline-specific logic, making it easier to manage and extend. We will explore this approach in the following.

````{note}
The *Ophyd* library provides several abstract methods that integrate seamlessly with BEC's scanning framework. Refer to the [ophyd section](#developer.ophyd.device) for details. Additionally, we recommend to explore the [scan structure](#developer.scans.scan_structure) section to understand the hierarchy and methods relevant during scans within BEC.

## Generic Integration Approach
The example above illustrates the challenges of integrating beamline-specific requirements into devices. To avoid repeating the same code for each device and prevent the implementation of beamline-specific logic from becoming complex and error-prone, we recommend encapsulating beamline-specific logic in a single location. This approach separates the logic for device communication and BEC communication as much as possible.

**Base Class for Device Integration**

We introduce a base class that wraps around the standard Ophyd interface. This base class provides hooks for beamline-specific logic, implemented through a separate class handling custom prepare actions.

In the code snippet below, the *stage* method of the *PSIDetectorBase* class includes a call to `self.custom_prepare.on_stage()`, which serves as a hook for beamline-specific logic during the staging process. Before this hook is executed, the class fetches and parses the latest scan information from BEC via `self.scaninfo.load_scan_metadata()`.

```{literalinclude} ../../../../../../ophyd_devices/ophyd_devices/interfaces/base_classes/psi_detector_base.py
:language: python
:pyobject: PSIDetectorBase.stage
:dedent: 4
```

This pattern allows flexibility by enabling the customisation of specific stages(e.g., `on_stage`, `on_unstage`, `on_complete`, etc.) without altering the core device or BEC logic. 

**Custom Prepare Actions**
The actual beamline-specific implementation resides in a separate class, passed to the *PSIDetectorBase* through the *custom_prepare_cls* attribute. This class is instantiated in the  *__init__* method of *PSIDetectorBase*.

```{literalinclude} ../../../../../../ophyd_devices/ophyd_devices/interfaces/base_classes/psi_detector_base.py
:language: python
:pyobject: PSIDetectorBase.__init__
:dedent: 4
```

The *custom_prepare_cls* is initialised as `self.custom_prepare_cls(parent=self, **kwargs)`,  allowing the beamline-specific logic to access all attributes and methods of the device class. This structured approach ensures modularity and allows seamless interaction between beamline logic and device functionality.

```{literalinclude} ../../../../../../ophyd_devices/ophyd_devices/interfaces/base_classes/psi_detector_base.py

```
````

While this approach introduces additional layers, it provides several key benefits:
- **Modularity:** Separates beamline-specific logic from device classes, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Reusability:** Beamline-specific logic can be reused across multiple devices.
- **Extensibility:** Additional hooks, such as `on_unstage` or `on_complete`, can be added to the custom class as needed.
- **Structured Implementation:** Beamline-specific logic is implemented in a plugin repository, ensuring a more organized codebase.


**Final Implementation**
The motor class can now adopt this approach by inheriting from both `EpicsMotor` and `PSIDeviceBase`. Beamline-specific logic is implemented in the `BeamlineCustomPrepare` class, which inherits from `CustomDetectorMixin` and overrides the necessary hooks. In this example, hooks like `on_stage`, `on_unstage` and `on_stop` ensure that motor velocity is restored to its original value even if the motor is stopped during an acquisition.

``` python
from ophyd import EpicsMotor
from ophyd_devices.interfaces.base_classes.psi_detector_base import (
    CustomDetectorMixin,
    PSIDetectorBase,
)

class BeamlineCustomPrepare(CustomDetectorMixin):
    
   def __init__(self, *_args, parent = None, **_kwargs):
      """ Beamline specific actions during initialization """
      super().__init__(_args=_args, parent=parent, _kwargs=_kwargs)
      self._stored_velocity = None

   def on_stage(self):
      """ Beamline specific actions during staging """
      if self.parent.scaninfo.scan_type == "fly":
         self._stored_velocity = self.parent.velocity.get()
         self.parent.velocity.set(2).wait()

   def on_unstage(self):
      """ Beamline specific actions during unstaging """
      self.on_stop()

   def on_stop(self):
      """ Beamline specific actions during stopping """
      if self._stored_velocity is not None:
         self.parent.velocity.set(self._stored_velocity).wait()
         self._stored_velocity = None
   

class MyBeamlineMotor(PSIDetectorBase, EpicsMotor):

    custom_prepare_cls = BeamlineCustomPrepare
```

A few final remarks on the implementation:
- The *parent* attribute allows beamline-specific logic to interact directly with the device class.
- The *velocity* component from *EpicsMotor* is accessible via `self.parent.velocity`.
- Since the *CustomDetectorMixin*'s `__init__` is overridden, ensure that `super().__init__(_args=_args, parent=parent, _kwargs=_kwargs)` is called correctly, especially passing the *parent* attribute.

## Summary
This approach introduces a  *PSIDetectorBase* class that provides utility methods for BEC interaction and separates beamline-specific logic into a *CustomDetectorMixin* class. Device classes inherit from both the core device class (e.g. *EpicsMotor*) and *PSIDetectorBase*, using the *custom_prepare* class variable to integrate beamline-specific logic via hooks as `on_stage`, `on_unstage`, etc.

By decoupling device communication, BEC interaction, and beamline-specific logic, this design improves code maintainability, extensibility, and modularity. Beamline-specific logic can now be implemented and extended within a dedicated plugin repository, ensuring a clean and organized implementation.
