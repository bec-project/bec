# User Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the *User* section of the BEC documentation!
BEC is an experiment control system built primarily in Python, providing both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). With BEC, users can control devices, perform scans, and analyze data efficiently.

This section provides an overview of the essential tools you’ll use when working with BEC—regardless of your prior experience.

### Key Topics

- [Installing the BEC client](#user.installation): Set up a local BEC client to connect to an existing BEC deployment.
- [Devices](#user.devices): Learn how to inspect, configure, and update device settings.
- [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](#user.command_line_interface): Control devices, motors, and scans. Write your own scripts and macros.
- [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#user.graphical_user_interface): Discover BEC Widgets, a powerful GUI framework for interacting with BEC.
- [Data Access and Plotting](#user.data_access_and_plotting): Explore and visualize scan data for live monitoring and online analysis.

If you're interested in extending BEC, customizing deployments, or understanding its internal architecture, please refer to the **[Developer](#developer)** section.
